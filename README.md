### Links

 - Live Site URL: (https://jvmcpheron.github.io/nft-card/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learned how to make a hover effect over an image (something I've honestly never done before).


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) - This is the Bootstrap documentation. It helped me with the majority of my styling, and helped me style the page quickly and efficiently.
